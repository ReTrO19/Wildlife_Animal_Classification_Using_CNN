## **Description**

This projects helps in classification of various wild animals using custom CNN network.

<font size="4"> **Use cases of this project**</font>

The CNN Network in this project is  trained in 6 classes of wild life animals.You can get the dataset from the following kaggle link.

## **How To Use**

#### **Main Installation**

```html
    > git clone https://github.com/ReTrO19/Wild_Animals_Classifer_Using_CNN.git
    > cd Wild_Animals_Classifer_Using_CNN
    # using pip
    > pip install -r requirements.txt
    # using conda
    > conda env create -f environment.yml
    > conda activate <env_name>
```

#### **How to run the inference**
```html
    (Run jupyter notebook for train the model and check accuracy and whatnot)
    # For exploring the model run following command
    > python run_test.py "<img_file_name>"
```

## **Outputs**
#### ( Model is trained on 2 class Nice and Peace )
#### **Detected Class: Nice**
```html
python run_test.py "00000593_300resized.png"
```
